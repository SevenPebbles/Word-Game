Name: Jose Astudillo
Project: Word Game

While following the textbook, I encountered errors with the textbook because you could not convert Vector3 lists to vector2 lists.
In order to solve this problem, I changed it to an array and converted it to a vector2 array and then back to a list.

There were also typos in the textbook version that I was using which caused syntax errors but by looking back at the code
I could find where the typos were at.

From this experience I learned to not put all of my code on one script because it was very difficult working with word game
after the textbook filled it with hundreds of lines of code.
